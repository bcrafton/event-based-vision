a smaller network with random weights actually works well
big problem is we are double boxing literally everything

~0.5 loss was corresponding to pretty much perfect accuracy, BUT we are double boxing everything.

something is up with obj/no_obj tho
because its usually a 50-50 split
and the loss is 0.5
AND we have double boxes.

total: 1392, rate: 33.584092, loss 0.495076 (7 0 53 38 0)

what about just a single box ?

there is def something wrong with calc_map i think.
